This is a FORTH system for personal understanding. It is still in the process of being created.  
I have saved two types of Intel 8086 source code (INOUE-FORTH and FIG-FORTH) that I used as reference to create it in Documents. The first ToUnderstandForth was based on INOUE-FORTH created in the 1980's. It was developed by rewriting Intel's 8086 source code into Intel's 64-bit source code. FORTH format and assembler format, which caused some bugs. We are currently working on a fix based on FIG-FORTH, which was written in assembler format only.  
  
The ToUnderstandForth source code was split into cpp and asm formats, and development was done in VisualStudio 2022 with MASM enabled. Unfortunately I was not able to convert them to EXE format; I developed them in debug mode in VisualStudio2022 and verified their operation in debug mode.  
  
The source code I am creating is only basic functionality for the FORTH system. I have developed a working FORTH system on an experimental basis and will aim for a more flexible FORTH system in the next development.
